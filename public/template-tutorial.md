# My Great Tutorial (D. Hilbert)
## Example lesson title

The simplest way to produce a tutorial is by writing it in markdown.
This tutorial was written in a simple markdown format.  After changing it,
you upload the resulting file (file name with a .md extension) via the "LOAD YOUR OWN TUTORIAL" tab
from the home page.  Give your modfied file to your students for them to upload (or just give them the URL)
so they can work through your lessons.

The line that begins with # is
the title for the tutorial.  Lines that begin with ## give the names
of each lesson.  Macaulay2
code that you wish to become buttons should be enclosed by backquotes (	`	) or
triple backquotes (	```	), as is shown below.

Blank lines start new paragraphs.

## Code
Macaulay2 commands (which will be displayed as clickable buttons) are
enclosed in triple backquotes (as is standard in many markdown
languages). Here we have blank lines between them, but that is not
required.

```
R = QQ[x]
```

```
x^3-x-1
```

or inline: `factor(x^2-1)`.

Multiple lines can be placed in one button too.

```
f = x -> (
    x^3-x-1
    )
```

## KaTeX
We use katex, which means that you can include math, in the following way:
using **\(** **\)** for inline: \(f(x) = x^3-\sin x + 1\), or in display form via
**\[** **\]**:
\[ \sum_{i=0}^n (x_i y_i + 1). \]


## More markdown
Other recognized markdown includes:
* lists
* *various* _standard_ **style** __modifications__
* [links](https://github.com/pzinn/Macaulay2Web)
* tables
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |

Caveat: markdown conversion can interfere with (Ka)TeX code.

## Other accepted formats

### HTML lessons
All tutorials are ultimately converted to HTML.
You can also upload lessons directly in HTML (file name with a .html extension).
Use <code> for Macaulay2 code.
This offers the most flexibility since no translation is performed except the following:
* The <title> tag (or the <header> if the former is absent) is used as title of the tutorial.
* Every <section> is a page (lesson) in the tutorial.
The <header> of each <section> is its title (for the table of contents on the HOME tab).
All content outside <section> will appear in every lesson.
If there is a <nav> section it will be transferred to the HOME tab (right before the table of contents).

### M2 files
You can directly upload a Macaulay2 file (file name with a .m2 extension). This offers the least flexibility,
as code is simply displayed as a single page.
