    <h1>Welcome Tutorial</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>Getting started</h2>

      <p>In this tutorial, we will show how to use this web site effectively.</p>

      <p>First, press the pulsating <b>START</b> button if you haven't already done so, to start a Macaulay2 session. On the right, the terminal (right hand window) should now display <br/>
	<span class="M2Text">Macaulay2, version a.b.c.d<br/>with packages: etc</span>

      <p>If you click on yellow highlighted \(\mac\) code, the results of running
	those commands will be displayed in the right hand window. You may also
	type directly into the right hand window.</p>

      <p>
	For example, click on this yellow code to compute the factors of the
	given polynomial.
	<code>R = QQ[x,y,z]</code>
	<code>F = (x-1)^3 - (y-1)^3</code>
	<code>factor F</code>
      </p>

      <p>
	This code is evaluated by \(\mac\) on the server.  This means that
	you don't need to have \(\mac\) or any of its included packages installed
	on your computer.</p>
      <p>You are on the first page of this tutorial.  At the top of the
	window, you see how many pages are in this tutorial.  After you are
	finished with a page, click or tap on the right arrow icon.  You can
	also go back to previous pages of the tutorial by clicking on the
	left arrow button.</p>

      <p>Right now, please continue to the next page of the tutorial.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Getting Macaulay2 help on a topic</h2>

      <p>There are two main ways of getting help on a topic in \(\mac\).  The first method gives you
	text help in the \(\mac\) output window.  For example,</p>
      <p><code>help determinant</code></p>
      <p>This displays in the \(\mac\) output window how to use the function "determinant".
	<b>Note!</b> In many browsers, you will have scroll bars to go back, but in some, notably most versions
	of Safari, the scrollbars are there but hidden!
      </p>

      <p>Alternatively, and more usefully, you may obtain the web version by using:</p>
      <p><code>viewHelp determinant</code></p>

      <p>This opens the documentation page in the <b>Browse</b> tab.  You can surf through the links
	there to see other \(\mac\) documentation. When you are ready to come back to the tutorial, click or tap on the
	<b>Tutorial</b> button at the top of the page.  You will end up right here! </p>

      <p>In either case, you can click on the example code, then press <b>Enter</b>, to run them yourself. Try to compute
	the determinant of the example $2\times 2$ matrix $M$ this way!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Using the Terminal</h2>
      <p>
	The right half of the screen is the <b>Terminal</b>, where the \(\mac\) action takes place!
	(You can expand/shrink it by dragging the blue separator between the two halves of the screen)</p>

      <p> You can type in \(\mac\) commands directly into the right hand side terminal; pressing <b>Enter</b>
	sends your commands to \(\mac\) to be executed.</p>

      <p>  You have various options to execute again past input:
	<ul>
	  <li>You can click on it, possibly edit it further;</li>
	  <li>You can select the bar on the left of its cell (possibly select multiple cells using <b>Shift</b> or <b>Ctrl</b>-clicking);</li>
	  <li>You can use the <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> arrow keys to go through the list of previous inputs;</li>
	  <li>You can type the beginning of the line, then press the <b>Right arrow</b> key for auto-completion.</li>
	</ul>
	In each case, press <b>Enter</b> as usual to send your input to \(\mac\).
      </p>
      <p>
	You can also use the <b>Tab</b> key for \(\mac\) keyword auto-completion.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Using the Editor</h2>
      <p>When you write M2 functions or long loops, it is often more convenient to write your code
	in a separate window and execute the code after you wrote it. This allows you to easily modify previous code and
	move the cursor around freely.</p>

      <p>Clicking or tapping the <b>Editor</b> button at the top of the page, navigates you to the editor tab in the
	left half of the screen.
	This is where you may type in \(\mac\) code and have it evaluated.</p>

      <p>In that window, place your cursor on a line that you wish to evaluate, and either click the
	<b>Evaluate</b> button, or press <b>Shift-Enter</b> (both keys at the same time).</p>

      <p>Alternatively, you may select several lines, or a part of a line, and clicking
	<b>Evaluate</b> (or press <b>Shift-Enter</b>) will evaluate the selection.</p>

      <p>You try it!  Click <b>Editor</b>, type in some \(\mac\) input, or try out some of the example
	lines already there. To come back to the tutorial, click or tap on the
	<b>Tutorial</b> button at the top of the page. </p>

      <p>
	Click on the <b>Load</b> and <b>Save</b> buttons at the top right of the editor tab to transfer the contents of a local file to the editor, and vice versa.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Macaulay2 sessions and the Reset button</h2>

      <p> When your browser starts, once you press the <b>Start</b> button, a \(\mac\) process is started on the server.
	All of your input, either typed and evaluated, or run by pressing buttons,
	goes to this process.  If you open a second window or tab in the same
	browser, you will get the same session.
      </p>

      <p>
	You might wish to start fresh, or restart \(\mac\), if a computation is
	going on too long.  In this case, press the <b>Reset</b> button (which replaces the initial <b>Start</b> button)
	at the top of the page.
      </p>

      <p>
	When you first connect to this web site and press <b>Start</b>, a cookie is generated, and that is used to connect to
	your \(\mac\) process on the server.  If you close your window or quit your browser, the
	cookie allows you to reconnect back to the same session next time. The \(\mac\) output will also be restored starting
	from the last time you pressed the <b>Start/Reset</b> button.
      </p>

      <p>
	Sometimes the server must be restarted for maintenance or other reasons, and at those times, all \(\mac\) processes
	are terminated.
      </p>


    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Advanced editing features</h2>
      <p>In both <b>Terminal</b> and <b>Editor</b> tabs, various advanced features are available:
	<ul>
	  <li>You can input greek letters and other unicode symbols with <b>Escape</b>[start of name]<b>Escape</b>
	    (e.g., try it with <tt>ZZ</tt>, <tt>QQ</tt>).</li>
	  <li>There is automatic syntax highlighting and delimiter matching.</li>
	  <li>Clicking on the bar left of a cell allows to copy/paste/shrink/wrap/group/run it;
	    right-click on the bar to see the list of options and keyboard shortcuts.</li>
	  <li>Press <b>F1</b> to get help on the selected text.</li>
	  <li>Press <b>Alt</b> to load the file whose name is the selected text into the <b>Editor</b>
	    (provided the file has been uploaded, see next section). You can use the syntax
	    <tt>filename.m2:1:5-5:10</tt> (as in \(\mac\) error messages) to highlight a portion of the text.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>Advanced file handling</h2>
      <h3>Uploading files</h3>
      <p>Use the <b>Upload File</b> button to upload files to the \(\mac\) server that can then be loaded into your \(\mac\) session. Suppose that you have uploaded a file named \(\verb|foo.m2|\) which contains \(\mac\) code.
	You may then load this file into \(\mac\) using either:
      </p>
      <p><code>load "foo.m2"</code></p>
      <p>
	or, if you wish to see all of the lines executed one by one:
      </p>
      <p><code>input "foo.m2"</code></p>
      <p><b>Note</b>: these lines will likely give errors now, as the file
	\(\verb|foo.m2|\) probably doesn't exist on the server!</p>
      <p>For your convenience, the content of the <b>Editor</b> tab is automatically uploaded as well. The default name
	<tt>default.m2</tt> can be changed at the bottom right, and is updated when you load a local file.</p>

      <h3>Running shell commands in your Macaulay2 session</h3>
      <p>It is possible to run shell commands from within \(\mac\), although many operations are restricted.
	For example, to see what files you have in your home directory on the server, try:</p>
      <p><code>run "ls -a"</code></p>
      Alternatively, if you want to obtain the output as a string, use
      <p><code>get "!ls -a"</code></p>

      <h3>Macaulay2 and temporary files</h3>
      <p>Sometimes \(\mac\) or one of its packages generate temporary files.
	For example, the graph function below creates dot and svg files.
      </p>
      <p><code>needsPackage "Graphs"</code></p>
      <p><code>A = graph({{a,b},{b,c},{b,d},{d,e}})</code></p>

      <h3>Getting files back to your machine</h3>
      <p>
	Sometimes your \(\mac\) code will create a file as output.  How to download
	this onto your machine?  Here is one way.  This first line creates a file for
	the purpose of this example.
	<code>"important-results.txt" &lt;&lt; "very important results" &lt;&lt; close</code>
	The next line will open the file in your <b>Browse</b> tab.
	<code>show URL "important-results.txt"</code>
	Alternatively, you can download it in the <b>Editor</b> tab: select with your mouse the file name (anywhere in your browser window) and press the <b>Alt</b> key (you can also go to the editor tab and manually type the file name in the bottom right corner). Try it with <tt>important-results.txt</tt> or the temporary files above!
      </p>

      <h3>Restrictions in place for the Macaulay2Web server</h3>
      <p>The server is being shared with other users, therefore memory and CPU time
	are limited (generous, but limited).  Other restrictions include: upload file size, number of processes that
	can run, and the amount of time that the session is saved on the server.
      </p>
      <p>Your user files are kept on the server even if you reset \(\mac\). There are 2 circumstances in which your files
	will be erased:
	<ul>
	  <li>When there are too many users, the users who have been inactive longest have their sessions terminated.</li>
	  <li>During server reboot, if the version of Macaulay2 on the server is upgraded, all user files
	    on the server are erased.</li>
	</ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Other advanced features</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>There is a chatroom (click on the <b>Chat</b> tab button. Supports some markdown (` for code, lists, tables, etc), (La)TeX. Default sends to everyone, with private messaging turned on default sends to your user id, or to the specified comma-separated list of recipients, where each recipient is of the form [alias] or [userid]/ or [userid]/[alias]).</li>
	<li>You can find your user id by clicking on the word cookie in the <b>Home</b> tab, or looking at the welcome message in chat.
	  You can change your user id by adding <tt>?user=[new id]</tt> to the URL.</li>
	<li>You may jump directly to a particular tutorial / lesson by adding e.g. <a href="#tutorial-4-2" target="_self">#tutorial-4-2</a> to the URL. (this works with uploaded tutorials as well)</li>
	<li>You may load into the editor a file stored in your session by adding e.g. <a href="#editor:file.m2" target="_self">#editor:file.m2</a> to the URL.</li>
	<li>Also note that a <a href="minimal.html" target="_blank">minimal version</a> of this interface exists. It can be embedded as an iframe into any web page.</li>
      </ul>
