	You can write your own tutorial, and then load it on this website
	(or, give it to your students, and let them load it). Download the
	file <a href="/template-tutorial.md" target="_blank">tutorial-template.md</a>
	which is both a template for your own tutorial, and a guide for how to write one.
	Or click on the lessons below to see the result.

    <section>
      <header><h2>Example lesson title</h2></header>
      <p>
	The simplest way to produce a tutorial is by writing it in markdown.
	This tutorial was written in a simple markdown format (the source
	is <a href="/tutorial-template.md" target="_blank">tutorial-template.md</a>). After changing it,
	you upload the resulting file (file name with a .md extension) via the &quot;LOAD YOUR OWN TUTORIAL&quot; tab
	from the home page.  Give your modfied file to your students for them to upload (or just give them the URL, e.g.,
	<a href="#tutorial-load">this tutorial</a>), so they can work through your lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
	The line that begins with # is
	the title for the tutorial.  Lines that begin with ## give the names
	of each lesson.  Macaulay2
	code that you wish to become buttons should be enclosed by backquotes (	`	) or
	triple backquotes (	```	), as is shown below.
      </p>
      <p>
	Blank lines start new paragraphs.
      </p>

    <section>
      <header><h2>Code</h2></header>
      <p>
	Macaulay2 commands (which will be displayed as clickable buttons) are
	enclosed in triple backquotes (as is standard in many markdown
	languages). Here we have blank lines between them, but that is not
	required.
      </p>
      <code class='block'>R = QQ[x]</code>
      <code class='block'>x^3-x-1</code>
      <p>
	or inline: <code>factor(x^2-1)</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
	Multiple lines can be placed in one button too.
      </p>
      <code class='block'>f = x -&gt; (
	x^3-x-1
	)</code>
    </section>
    <section>
      <header><h2>KaTeX</h2></header>
      <p>
	We use KaTeX, which means that you can include math, in the following way:
	using <strong>\(</strong> <strong>\)</strong> for inline: \(f(x) = x^3-\sin x + 1\), or in display form via
	<strong>\[</strong> <strong>\]</strong>:
	\[ \sum_{i=0}^n (x_i y_i + 1). \]
      </p>

      <header><h2>More markdown</h2></header>
      <p>Other recognized markdown includes:
	<ul>
	  <li>lists</li>
	  <li><em>various</em> <u>standard</u> <strong>style</strong> <u><strong>modifications</strong></u></li>
	  <li><a href='https://github.com/pzinn/Macaulay2Web'>links</a></li>
	  <li>tables</li>
	</ul>
	<table><tr><td> 1 </td><td> 2 </td><td> 3 </td></tr><tr><td> 4 </td><td> 5 </td><td> 6 </td></tr></table>
      </p>
      <p>
	Caveat: markdown conversion can interfere with (Ka)TeX code.

      <header><h2>Other accepted formats</h2></header>
      <h3>HTML lessons</h3>
      <p>All tutorials are ultimately converted to HTML (see <a href="tutorials/load.html" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>).
	You can also upload lessons directly in HTML (file name with a .html extension).
	Use &lt;code&gt; for Macaulay2 code.
	This offers the most flexibility since no translation is performed except the following.
      </p>
      <p>The &lt;title&gt; tag (or the &lt;header&gt; if the former is absent) is used as title of the tutorial.
	Every &lt;section&gt; is a page (lesson) in the tutorial.
	The &lt;header&gt; of each &lt;section&gt; is its title (for the table of contents on the HOME tab).
	All content outside &lt;section&gt; will appear in every lesson.
	If there is a &lt;nav&gt; section it will be transferred to the HOME tab (right before the table of contents).
      </p>
      <h3>M2 files</h3>
      <p>You can directly upload a Macaulay2 file (file name with a .m2 extension). This offers the least flexibility,
	as code is simply displayed as a single page.
